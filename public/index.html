        <p>Vapor is an online video game store owned by Spigot 
            that sells $15 million in video games annually. 
            Vapor has 500,000 registered accounts, and 1500 game 
            studios publish their products on the website. This
            database will track customer profiles, along with their
            game orders. It will also keep track of game studios
            partnered with Vapor, and their respective published
            games. Games will also be categorized with a list of genres,
            so customers may be able to search by specific genres when
            browsing the game store.
